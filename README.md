# rdb-2

The sequel to my entirely unpopular kitchen-sink Discord bot.

## Features

The current list of features of the bot is as follows:

- ping - Ping Pong!
- coinflip - Flips a coin.
- diceroll - Rolls n dice with n sides.

I am currently working on importing pre-existing commands from the old bot onto this new platform. Bear with me here, there's a lot.

## Libraries used

[interactions.py](https://github.com/interactions-py/interactions.py) - The heart of the machine.

## Contribution

I am always open to new ideas and suggestions. Feel free to create a PR, or contact me at cfordx86@gmail.com.
